# URWallet

This is a flutter project by Maxim Gorshkov, Sidhant Bendre, and Tharun Sathiyamoorthy. This is an app idea for the DandyHacks 2020 hackathon. The idea is to create a wallet for the students of the University of Rochester to manage the different forms of virtual money, and send it between each other!

This version is not functional on its own: API keys have been removed. For a full working demonstration and for more information, visit https://devpost.com/software/urwallet
