# URWallet

This is a flutter project by Maxim Gorshkov, Sidhant Bendre, and Tharun Sathiyamoorthy. This is an app idea for the DandyHacks 2020 hackathon. The idea is to create a wallet for the students of the University of Rochester to manage the different forms of virtual money, and send it between each other!
